# The Game Of Life
John Conway's Game of Life. Fills in the initial generation randomly with a chance of 50% of the cells being alive and the
other 50% dead.

## Running the simulation
Have `Java` installed and available in your `$PATH`. Run `java TheGameOfLife` in this repo's directory. If you make any changes
to the `.java` file, run `javac TheGameOfLife.java` to compile the code before running `java TheGameOfLife`.
